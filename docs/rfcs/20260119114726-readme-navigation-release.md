# RFC: README Navigation Improvements

## Staging
ZID: 20260119114726
Updated File: `README.md`

## Implementation Details

### Analytics
- **Readability**: As the project grows, navigating a single document becomes more difficult. Adding a Table of Contents (TOC) allows users to jump directly to sections of interest.
- **Convenience**: Adding "Return to top" links at the end of each major section helps with quick navigation back to the TOC or header.

### Decisions
1. **TOC**: Added a list of internal markdown links to the top of the document.
2. **Back-to-top**: Added localized links at the end of each H2 section pointing back to the main document header.
